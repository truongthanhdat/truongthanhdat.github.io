  <h1>The way I came to VNOI and ACM-ICPC</h1>

  <div class="entry" align="justify">
    <p>First, I would like to thanks for visiting my blog. In this topic, I would like to say the way I came to VNOI which is a leverage makes me came to ACM ICPC.</p>

<p>When I was a ten-grade student, I wondered in selecting Maths team and Informatics team. Finally, I chose Informatics team, because I thought informatics has more meaning, application, reality more than maths. Quang-Liem Luu is a teacher who had guided me for 3 years.</p>

<p>Starting with zero backgrounds about algorithms and data structure, I just knew Pascal language at this time. I started learning new algorithms and data structure from my teacher, internet, books, … I practiced in online judge every day (such as SPOJ, Codeforces, …). Until Aril, 2013, I was selected to the Olympic team and participated in this contest which organized by Le Hong Phong high school for the gifted. In this contest, I achieved Gold medal which is an only gold medal of my school. Until now, I am still proud of this. Then, I achieved many informatics prizes and I have become a contestant of VNOI contest for the first time (in 2014). Unfortunately, I just achieved honor prize in this contest, my expectation was the third prize. I felt disappointed but I didn’t give up. I started re-practicing more and more. I continued achieving Goal medal in Olympic in 2014 and many informatics prizes. Once again, I became a contestant of VNOI contest in 2015 and it is the last opportunity that I could achieve my expectation which was second prize. Finally, I have done it.</p>

<p>When I was in the very beginning of 12 grade, I was contacted by Son-Tung N. Pham who was an ACM ICPC coach of Ho Chi Minh University of Science. He helped me have more power to completed VNOI contest well. He also took me to ACM ICPC. He gave me many opportunities in order to I came to ACM ICPC. He scheduled a training calendar for me, supported me, … Today I have many things, experiences, knowledge, … is also thanks him partly. I was selected to ACM ICPC team to attended at Jakarta and Ha Noi. My teammates were Xuan-Phuc Nguyen and Van-Thuyen Phan. Van-Thuyen Phan was an ACM ICPC World Final contestant in 2013. I felt lucky when I was put on this team. I tried hard to do my duties well. Finally, my team was in Top 12 final ranking in Jakarta and achieved second prize in Ha Noi. Next year, my teammates were Xuan-Phuc Nguyen and Hanh-Trinh H. Phan. This team made me happiest although we failed in this year. In 2017, my teammates were Duc-Tan Lan and Hieu-Minh To.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t follow ACM ICPC contest because I have a new target. My passion is research in Computer Vision and Deep Learning and I am following this. In future, I am going to become a Ph.D. in Computer Vision field and a lecturer in a University. This is my dream and I am doing this.</p>

<p>In conclusion, once again, I would like to thanks for reading my story. VNOI and ACM ICPC is always my memory that I cannot forget.</p>
