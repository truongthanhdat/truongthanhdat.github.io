                                        My main researches focus on Computer Vision and Machine Learning which widely include general problems such as
                                        Image Classificaion, Object Detection, Generative Models, Domain Adaptation, Domain Generalization, Medical Imaging, etc.

                                        <h3>Domain Generalization</h3>
                                        Deep learning-based detection and recognition studies have been recently achieving very accurate performance in visual applications.
                                        However, many such methods assume the testing images come from the same distribution as the training ones, and often fail when performing 
                                        in new unseen domains. 
                                        Indeed, detection and classification crossing domains have recently become active topics in the research communities. 
                                        In particular, domain adaptation has received significant attention in computer vision. 
                                        <br>
                                        In the domain adaptation, we usually have a large-scale training set with labels, i.e. 
                                        the source domain A, and a small training set with or without labels, 
                                        i.e. the target domain B. The knowledge from the source domain A will be learned and adapted to the target domain B. During the 
                                        testing time, the trained model will be deployed only in the target domain B. Recent results in domain adaptation 
                                        have showed significant improvement in the many computer vision applications. However, the trained models are potentially 
                                        deployed not only in the target domain B but also in many other new unseen domains in real-world applications. 
                                        In this scenarios, the released deep network models are usually unable to be retrained or fine-tuned with the
                                         inputs in new unseen domains or environments as illustrated. Thus, domain adaptation cannot be applied in these problems 
                                         since the new unseen target domains are unavailable. 
            
                                        <br>
                                        Besides, there are some prior works to perform recognition problems with high accuracy by presenting new loss functions
                                        or increasing deep network structures via mining hard samples in training sets. These loss functions are deployed to deal 
                                        with hard samples considered as unseen domains.
                                        However, these methods are limited to be generalized in new unseen domains in real wold applications.
                                        Some real world problems are unable to observe training samples from new unseen domains in the training process.
                                        Therefore, in the scope of this work, there is no assumption about the new unseen domains. 
                                

                                        <h3>Lifelogging Retrieval</h3>
                                        Collecting and analyzing daily activity logs can provide potential insights for better understanding and possible 
                                        optimization for individual and organizational activities and operations. There are multiple sources to gather 
                                        information in various formats during daily activities. People usually post photos, video clips, or messages to their 
                                        social channels everyday. People may record their daily activities with wearable cameras or other types of sensors. 
                                        <br>
                                        Millions of surveillance cameras capture various events in traffic systems, offices, or supermarkets. It is an increasing 
                                        demand to process and analyze such information, mostly in visual format, to develop useful services and utilities for smart environments.
                                        Our researches are based on practical social needs and aim to provide people natural experience with smart 
                                        services and utilities, such as: Lost items can be found or memories can be retrieved or verified by searching daily logs, 
                                        Reminiscence can help people to positively revive past memories and connections with their relatives, etc.
                                
                                        <h3>Traffic Analysis</h3>

                                        Nowadays, traffic data was collected from surveillane cameras are increasing quickly. It leads to many demands were raised. 
                                        Traffic analysis is not out of its demands. For the huge traffic data was collected every day, it requires we have a automatic 
                                        system for tracking, abnormal detection, vehicle re-identification, etc. These researches mainly focus on:

                                        Image and Video Retrieval  is  an  interactive  process  where  a  user inspects   the   content   of   a   single   
                                        image   or   video.  This  exploratory  search  approach  is  required when  a  user  wants  to  
                                        know  what  content  or  information  is contained. Moreover,   it   can   also   be   used for   retrieval 
                                        scenarios  where  users  want  to  find  a  particular  content  but cannot  describe  it  through  
                                        a  query (“I  will  know  it  when  I see it”).
