  <h2 style="color:steelblue;">Introduction</h2>

  <div align="justify">
    Insect-related disasters are one of the most important factors affecting crop yield due to the fast reproduction and
    widely distributed,
    large variety of insects. In the agricultural revolution, detecting and recognizing insects plays an important role
    in
    the ability for
    crops to grow healthily and produce a high-quality yield. To achieve this, insect recognition helps to differentiate
    between bugs that
    must be targeted for pest control and bugs that are essential for protecting farms. While the kinds of insects are
    broad and available
    insect datasets have been collected from different sources, the existing insect recognition models trained on a
    specific dataset with particular,
    predefined insects. Thus, the previous approaches on insect recognition are unable to recognize new types of insects
    from other datasets as well
    as utilize the knowledge from different datasets. Machine learning, especially deep learning requires a large volume
    of data to achieve high performance
    hence transferring and utilizing knowledge from various datasets are essential. Therefore, we propose a new deep
    learning-based domain adaptation
    algorithm to address these problems. By minimizing the gap of
    distributions between different datasets, our proposed method can generalize well on the new target domains. In
    addition, we design a hardware system so that we
    deploy our deep learning model the complete system to run in real-world farms.

      <h2 style="color:steelblue;">Our Solution</h2>
      We introduce a completed hardware design for insect monitoring.
      In particular, we propose a novel, end-to-end hardware that integrates a set of cameras, a motion detection
      sensor,
      a low-cost computer, and lighting modules to a unit system to capture and classify flying insects.
      The system consists of two cameras that capture the top view and lateral view of insects. The motion sensor is
      integrated to detect the
      existence of the insects based on their movement into the imaging zone. Then, the sensor sends a signal to the
      cameras to initiate image capture.
      The system is designed to deploy in various conditions in which the environmental lighting is not ideal for taking
      images (e.g., monitoring fields at night).
      Hence, the LEDs are integrated to support and improve the quality of taken images. The cameras and LEDs have been
      carefully timed by our hardware trigger
      design to guarantee that the cameras take images at the same time as the LED flashes so that the taken images have
      the best quality of brightness.
      Finally, the taken images are sent immediately to the low-cost computer for further processing. Particularly, the
      computer takes the images taken
      from the two cameras and performs the AI algorithm to detect and classify the types of insects. The AI algorithm
      has been developed
      by our team by using the domain adaptation technique to train the AI model in an unsupervised manner.
      Specifically, we develop the unsupervised domain adaptation technique to train the deep convolutional neural
      network on the insect photos collected on the farms.
      Also, the computational cost of the AI algorithm has been optimized so that we can effectively deploy on the
      low-cost computer.
      In addition, to attract the insects coming into the system, the described hardware and AI system will be attached
      to an existing trap system that utilizes light
      and semiochemicals to attract insects. To be able to deploy on the farm where the electric power is limited, the
      power of the entire system is provided by solar energy.
